# NBA Data Analysis

Welcome to the NBA Data Analysis repository! This project aims to provide insights into NBA (National Basketball Association) data through data analysis and visualization techniques. By analyzing historical NBA game data, we can uncover trends, patterns, and interesting insights about teams, players, and games.

## Concept

The code provided in this repository performs various data analysis tasks on NBA data, including:

- Loading NBA game data from a CSV file.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Visualizing NBA team performance over time using line charts and bar charts.
- Conducting statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis, to uncover relationships and trends in the data.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to download and run the code:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
`git clone https://github.com/aggelospaschos/nba_data_analysis.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scipy`

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the `Introduction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains the code for NBA data analysis.

4. **Run the Code**: Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the NBA data analysis tasks.

5. **Explore the Results**: Once the code has finished running, explore the generated visualizations and analysis results to gain insights into NBA data.
